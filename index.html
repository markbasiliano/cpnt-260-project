            Boxing is a very tactical sport and it takes a lot of heart, training, dedication, commitment, and discipline to excel at being a boxer. I love the sport for the science of hitting while not getting hit.
            It can be scary and gruesome at some points but so rewarding to see the fruits of labour of the boxers efforts. To see them show the skills and stamina that they trained so very hard for is so inspiring. I love the world of boxing and I'm excited to share this with you!
